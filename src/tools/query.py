    ## üöÄ **STREAMLINED WORKFLOW** (Only 4 Steps):

    1. **Connect**: Use `connect_database()` to establish connection
    2. **Analyze**: Use `get_analysis_context()` - gets schema + ontology + relationships automatically
    3. **Validate**: Use `validate_sql_syntax()` before execution  
    4. **Execute**: Use `execute_sql_query()` to run validated queries

    ## üéØ **Using the Ontology for Accurate SQL**:
    The `get_analysis_context()` tool provides an ontology containing:
    - **Ready-to-use SQL column references**: `customers.customer_id`, `orders.order_total`
    - **Complete JOIN conditions**: `orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id`
    - **Business context**: "Customer information and profile data"
    
    Extract these from the ontology TTL format and use them directly in your SQL queries.

    ## üö® CRITICAL SQL TRAP PREVENTION PROTOCOL üö®

    ### MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST

    **1. üîç RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS (REQUIRED)**
    - ALWAYS call `get_table_relationships()` first
    - Identify ALL 1:many relationships in your query
    - Flag any table appearing on "many" side of multiple relationships

    **2. üéØ FAN-TRAP DETECTION (CRITICAL)**

    **IMMEDIATE RED FLAGS:**
    - ‚ùå Sales + Shipments + SUM() = GUARANTEED FAN-TRAP
    - ‚ùå Any fact table + dimension + aggregation = HIGH RISK
    - ‚ùå Multiple LEFT JOINs + GROUP BY = DANGER ZONE
    - ‚ùå Joining 3+ tables with SUM/COUNT/AVG = LIKELY INFLATED RESULTS

    **PATTERN CHECK:**
    ```
    If query has: FROM tableA JOIN tableB JOIN tableC 
    WHERE tableA‚ÜítableB (1:many) AND tableA‚ÜítableC (1:many)
    Then: GUARANTEED CARTESIAN PRODUCT MULTIPLICATION
    Result: SUM(tableA.amount) will be artificially inflated!
    ```

    **3. üõØf MANDATORY VALIDATION**
    - Call `validate_sql_syntax()` before execution
    - Review warnings about query complexity
    - Check for multiple table joins with aggregation

    ## ‚úÖ SAFE QUERY PATTERNS

    ### üîí PATTERN 1 - UNION APPROACH (RECOMMENDED FOR MULTI-FACT)

    **Best for:** Multiple fact tables (sales, shipments, returns, etc.)

    ```sql
    WITH unified_facts AS (
        -- Sales facts
        SELECT 
            client_id, 
            product_id, 
            sales_amount as amount, 
            0 as shipment_qty, 
            0 as return_qty,
            'SALES' as fact_type
        FROM sales
        
        UNION ALL
        
        -- Shipment facts  
        SELECT 
            client_id, 
            product_id, 
            0 as amount, 
            shipment_quantity, 
            0 as return_qty,
            'SHIPMENT' as fact_type
        FROM shipments s JOIN sales sal ON s.sales_id = sal.id
        
        UNION ALL
        
        -- Return facts
        SELECT 
            client_id, 
            product_id, 
            0 as amount, 
            0 as shipment_qty, 
            return_quantity,
            'RETURN' as fact_type  
        FROM returns r JOIN sales sal ON r.sales_id = sal.id
    )
    SELECT 
        client_id,
        product_id,
        SUM(amount) as total_sales,
        SUM(shipment_qty) as total_shipped,
        SUM(return_qty) as total_returned
    FROM unified_facts 
    GROUP BY client_id, product_id;
    ```

    **Advantages:**
    - ‚úÖ Natural fan-trap immunity by design
    - ‚úÖ Unified data model for consistent aggregation
    - ‚úÖ Easy to extend with additional fact types
    - ‚úÖ Single aggregation logic for all measures
    - ‚úÖ Better performance with fewer table scans

    ### üîí PATTERN 2 - SEPARATE AGGREGATION (LEGACY APPROACH)

    **Use when:** UNION approach is not suitable

    ```sql
    WITH fact1_totals AS (
        SELECT key, SUM(amount) as total_amount 
        FROM fact1 GROUP BY key
    ),
    fact2_totals AS (
        SELECT key, SUM(quantity) as total_quantity 
        FROM fact2 GROUP BY key
    )
    SELECT 
        f1.key, 
        f1.total_amount,
        COALESCE(f2.total_quantity, 0) as total_quantity
    FROM fact1_totals f1 
    LEFT JOIN fact2_totals f2 ON f1.key = f2.key;
    ```

    ### üîí PATTERN 3 - DISTINCT AGGREGATION (USE CAREFULLY)

    **Warning:** Only use when you fully understand the data relationships

    ```sql
    SELECT 
        key, 
        SUM(DISTINCT fact1.amount) as total_amount,
        SUM(fact2.quantity) as total_quantity 
    FROM fact1 
    LEFT JOIN fact2 ON fact1.id = fact2.fact1_id 
    GROUP BY key;
    ```

    ### üîí PATTERN 4 - WINDOW FUNCTIONS

    **For:** Complex analytical queries with preserved granularity

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        key, 
        SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY key) as total_amount,
        pre_aggregated_quantity
    FROM fact1 
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT key, SUM(qty) as pre_aggregated_quantity 
        FROM fact2 GROUP BY key
    ) f2 USING(key);
    ```

    ## üîÑ RESULT VALIDATION (POST-EXECUTION)

    **Always verify results make business sense:**
    - Compare totals with business expectations
    - Verify: `SELECT SUM(amount) FROM base_table` vs your query result
    - Check row counts are reasonable
    - If results seem too high ‚Üí likely fan-trap occurred

    ## üìù COMMON DEADLY COMBINATIONS TO AVOID

    ‚ùå **Never do these without proper fan-trap prevention:**
    - `sales LEFT JOIN shipments + SUM(sales.amount)`
    - `orders LEFT JOIN order_items LEFT JOIN products + SUM(orders.total)`
    - `customers LEFT JOIN transactions LEFT JOIN transaction_items + aggregation`
    - Any query joining parent‚Üíchild1 + parent‚Üíchild2 with SUM/COUNT

    ## üéØ RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS EXAMPLES

    **SAFE (1:1 relationships):**
    ```
    customers ‚Üí customer_profiles (1:1) ‚úÖ
    ```

    **RISKY (1:many):**
    ```
    customers ‚Üí orders (1:many) ‚ö†Ô∏è
    ```

    **DEADLY (fan-trap):**
    ```
    orders ‚Üí order_items (1:many) + orders ‚Üí shipments (1:many) üö®
    ```

    **IF YOUR QUERY INCLUDES THE DEADLY PATTERN:**
    ‚Üí STOP! Rewrite using UNION approach or separate aggregation CTEs

    ## üîß EMERGENCY FAN-TRAP FIX

    If you suspect fan-trap in existing query:
    1. **Split into UNION approach** (recommended)
    2. **Use separate aggregations**
    3. **Add DISTINCT in SUM()** as temporary fix
    4. **Validate results** against source tables
    5. **Always aggregate fact tables separately** before joining

    **Remember:** Fan-traps cause SILENT DATA CORRUPTION! Your query will execute successfully but return WRONG RESULTS. The bigger the multiplication factor, the more wrong your data becomes.

    ## ‚ö° AUTOMATED CHECK

    If your query involves more than 2 tables and includes SUM/COUNT/AVG, you MUST analyze for fan-traps before execution. No exceptions!

    ## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

    Only proceed with `execute_sql_query()` after ALL checks pass:
    - [ ] Schema analyzed ‚úì
    - [ ] Relationships analyzed ‚úì  
    - [ ] Fan-trap patterns checked ‚úì
    - [ ] Syntax validated ‚úì
    - [ ] Safe aggregation pattern used ‚úì
    - [ ] Results make business sense ‚úì

    ## Security Restrictions

    **ALLOWED:**
    - SELECT statements
    - Common Table Expressions (WITH)
    - EXPLAIN statements
    - Database metadata queries

    **PROHIBITED:**
    - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements
    - DDL operations (CREATE, DROP, ALTER)
    - Transaction control (COMMIT, ROLLBACK)
    - System functions that modify state
    - Dynamic SQL execution

    ## Performance Guidelines

    **Query Optimization:**
    - Use appropriate indexes via schema analysis
    - Limit result sets with WHERE clauses
    - Use EXPLAIN to understand query plans
    - Monitor execution time warnings

    **Resource Management:**
    - Default limit: 1000 rows
    - Maximum limit: 5000 rows  
    - Automatic timeout protection
    - Memory usage monitoring

    ## Error Handling

    **Common Error Types:**
    - **Syntax errors**: Use `validate_sql_syntax()` first
    - **Permission errors**: Check allowed query types
    - **Timeout errors**: Simplify complex queries
    - **Memory errors**: Reduce result set size

    **Best Practices:**
    - Always validate syntax before execution
    - Start with small result sets
    - Use LIMIT clauses appropriately
    - Monitor execution time and warnings

    ## Examples

    ### Multi-Fact Query (Recommended)
    ```sql
    WITH unified_facts AS (
        SELECT customer_id, product_id, sales_amount, 0 as returns, 'SALES' as type
        FROM sales
        UNION ALL
        SELECT customer_id, product_id, 0, return_amount, 'RETURNS' as type  
        FROM returns r JOIN sales s ON r.sales_id = s.id
    )
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(sales_amount) as net_sales, SUM(returns) as total_returns
    FROM unified_facts GROUP BY customer_id;
    ```

    ### Safe Aggregation Query
    ```sql
    WITH customer_sales AS (
        SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) as total_sales
        FROM sales GROUP BY customer_id
    )
    SELECT c.name, cs.total_sales
    FROM customers c
    LEFT JOIN customer_sales cs ON c.id = cs.customer_id
    ORDER BY cs.total_sales DESC;
    ```

        sql_query: SQL query to execute (must pass validation first)
        limit: Maximum number of rows to return (default: 1000, max: 5000)
